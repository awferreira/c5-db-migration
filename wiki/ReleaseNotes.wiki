==0.9.1 released on 2008-08-29==

A number of changes were made that break backwards compatibility.  We try to keep things stable but has to make a few fundamental improvements before deeming this framework worthy of a 1.0 status.  We'll try to minimize such changes in the future.

*New Features and Improvements*

  * _Removed explicit support for "environments" as maven profiles provide a more flexible and robust solution._
  * _Version history table schema has changed and now all applied migrations are captured (not just the last version)._
  * Timestamps are now the recommended version string (instead of 001, 002, etc).
  * Migrations don't necessarily have to run in strict order; all pending migrations are run in order however.  This in conjunction with timestamp versions prevent developers from stepping on each others migrations.
  * _Renamed artifact ids:_
    * maven-migration-plugin -> maven-db-migration-pluging
    * migration -> db-migration
    * db-support -> db-support-parent
  * _Lots of shifting code around between modules and packages._
  * Added db-migration:create, drop, and reset for MySQL and PostreSQL.
  * Enhanced db-migration:validate to display pending migrations.

_Italicized_ changes are not backwards compatible.

*Upgrading*

  # Update the artifactIds and maven-db-migration-plugin configuration.
  # Move your migrations to the new default location (src/main/db/migrations).
  # Update your migrations and version history, by (choose one):
    * Rename existing migrations to use the timestamp format, drop your database, and then migrate.  Of course this is impossible in production.
    * Manually change the schema_version table to match "create table version_schema (version varchar(32) not null unique, applied_on timestamp not null, duration int not null)" and add a row for each already applied migration.  You can also rename the migrations as part of this process.
