==0.9.1 released on 2008-08-29==

A number of changes were made that break backwards compatibility.  We try to keep things stable but has to make a few fundamental improvements before deeming this framework worthy of a 1.0 status.  We'll try to minimize such changes in the future.

*Incompatibilities*

  * Removed explicit support for "environments" as maven profiles provide a more flexible and robust solution.
  * Version history table schema has changed and now all applied migrations are captured (not just the last version).
  * Timestamps are now the recommended version string (instead of 001, 002, etc).
  * Migrations don't necessarily have to run in strict order; all pending migrations are run in order however.  This in conjunction with timestamp versions prevent developers from stepping on each others migrations.
  * Renamed artifacts ids:
    * maven-migration-plugin -> maven-db-migration-pluging
    * migration -> db-migration
    * db-support -> db-support-parent
  * Lots of shifting code around.

*New Features and Improvements*

  * db-migration:create, drop, and reset for MySQL and PostreSQL
  * db-migration:validate now displays pending migrations
