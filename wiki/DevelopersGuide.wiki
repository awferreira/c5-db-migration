There are several key high-level classes in the migration framework:

*Migration*
Represents a single migration patch tied to a migration sequence.  Currently only SQL migrations are supported, but initial support for Groovy and Ruby migrations exists in the code base.

*!MigrationResolver*
Finds available migrations from the filesystem or classpath.  The default implementation - ResourceMigrationResolver - loads migrations using the classpath url "classpath:/db/migrations/*.sql".

*!MigrationManager* 
Orchestrates the the migration process by determining the current version, latest version, and running the appropriate migrations.

*!VersionStrategy*
Defines a strategy for capturing the current database version.  The default implementation - SimpleVersionStrategy - creates a database table called 'schema_version' with a single column 'version'.

*!VersionExtractor*

Given a filename, this extracts the migration's sequence number (i.e. version).
